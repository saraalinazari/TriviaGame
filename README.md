# TriviaGame
- I have 5 questions and I prefered to show them one by one not randomly. 
- For each question, I have the counter of time that gives the user 10 seconds to answer.
- If user answer the question, it shows the result if she answers correct or not. If use does not answer it counts down to 0 and show to the user that she did not answered the question. It shows the results 5 seconds and automatically goes to the next question.
